# TODO
Things to do for this website

## Sound example page
Borrow from previous website to build a nice page for showing sound examples for different species. I could probably write it in Rmd and make use of the nice .tabset feature for displaying each species.

## Friends page
Links to people doing similar things, or other cool stuff

## Ideas for future posts
* Bathymetric maps in R
* Convert from LaTeX to MS Word (`latex2rtf`)
* Logistic regression in R  
* LDA in R  
* Latex templates (CV, presentation, poster, etc)  
* Interactive map with Shiny and leaflet
* Interactive plot annotation with Shiny
* Make movie from plots in R
* Crosstalk with leaflet and plotly
* ...

## Fixes
* Consider reducing text size for nicer online look
* Update projects (Detection range modeling / validation)
