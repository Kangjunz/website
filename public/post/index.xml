      <description>Many of the R projects I start don&amp;rsquo;t pan out and end up in a scrap directory somewhere, but once in awhile I make enough progress to get worried that I&amp;rsquo;ll lose track of it. That&amp;rsquo;s when I know it&amp;rsquo;s time to get it up on GitHub. This post is mostly just a way for me to remember how to get an existing R project on GitHub. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are better ways of doing this in the command line, but I&amp;rsquo;m still pretty new to Git so I&amp;rsquo;m sticking with what I know works.</description>

      <title>Spectrograms in R</title>

      <description>The spectrogram is one of the most important tools in a bioacoustician’s arsenal. They can help us see what we do not or cannot hear. I generate and plot spectrograms in a variety of ways. Typically, I turn to Audacity if I want to plot something up quickly, Raven to make a few quick measurements or annotations, and Matlab for anything more detailed. This is all fine and good, but recently I’ve had a few projects that require producing some nice looking spectrograms in R.</description>
