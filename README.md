My personal website and blog: http://hansenjohnson.org/

## Overview

This is a static webpage generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The design and framework are based on the [Academic Theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) for Hugo. It is automatically published from this GitHub repo using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Workflow

I rely heavily on the R [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package and Rstudio to publish a live preview of the website, seamlessly publish Rmarkdown documents as blog posts, and manage version control with GitHub. I also used GitHub's [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor to do a lot of the theme editing and project-level management.
