    My name is Hansen Johnson. I'm a PhD student at Dalhousie University, and a guest student at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution where I'm advised by
    <a href="http://fishocean.ocean.dal.ca/about/">Dr. Chris Taggart</a> and
    <a href="http://www.whoi.edu/sbl/liteSite.do?litesiteid=5252">Dr. Mark Baumgartner</a>,
    respectively. I study baleen whale acoustic and habitat ecology in the Northwest Atlantic. I use this site to share some aspects of my
    <a href="/projects/#research">research</a> and some helpful <a href="/tools/">tools</a> of the trade. I also occasionally write <a href="/tools/">posts</a> about things I think are worth remembering or sharing. If you're interested in any of this stuff, please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>!
