summary: Introduction to plotting ocean data with ggplot
---



<p>I recently put together a quick tutorial on plotting using <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>. The content of the examples caters to ocean science applications, but hopefully the concepts are universal. Iâ€™ve always liked the <a href="https://bookdown.org/">bookdown</a> format, so opted to give that a try. Check it out <a href="https://hansenjohnson.github.io/ggplot2_tutorial/">here</a>, and as always please feel free to get in touch with any comments or suggestions.</p>
