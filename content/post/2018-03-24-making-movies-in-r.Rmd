## Overview

I often work with data that vary in both time and space. Underwater gliders, for example, move around as they explore the ocean for weeks to months at a time. Its likely that the ocean changes not only depending on where they go, but when they go there. So, changes in time and space are important, but can be very difficult to visualize with typical static plots. Interactive plots can be great tools for that kind of thing. Movies can help too. This post outlines a quick means of producing a movie in `R`.

## Data

I chose to create a simple 'gif' movie of the track of Captain Cook's voyage around the world on the HMS Endeavor. The data are available in the [ocedata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ocedata/ocedata.pdf) package.

``` {r data}
library(oce)
library(ocedata)
data(coastlineWorld)
data(endeavour)

# plot full track
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, type='l', proj='+proj=moll', col='lightgray')
mapPoints(endeavour$longitude, endeavour$latitude, pch=20, cex=2/3, col='red')
```

This kind of static map provides a nice global overview, but doesn't give a great sense of how that the voyage progressed over time.

## Create temporary maps

The next step is to generate timesteps spanning the entire voyage, then create a map of the ship track during each timestep and save it to a temporary file. [For the sake of concision the output is not shown in this post] 

``` {r maps, eval=FALSE}
# input parameters
map_dir = 'figures' # directory for temporary maps
outfile = 'static/movie.gif' # movie file (this could be several different file types)
movie_speed = 5 # movie play speed

# rename data
df = endeavour

# make maps ---------------------------------------------------------------
if(!dir.exists(map_dir)){dir.create(map_dir)}

# start and end times
t0 = min(df$time)
t1 = max(df$time)

# time vector
tseq = seq.POSIXt(t0, t1+31*60*60*24, by = 'month')

# make and save maps
for(it in 1:(length(tseq)-1)){
  
  # subset within timestep
  it0 = tseq[it]
  it1 = tseq[it+1]
  idf = df[df$time >= it0 & df$time <= it1,]
  
  # open map file
  png(paste0(map_dir,'/', as.character(format(it0, '%Y-%m-%d.png'))), 
      width=6, height=6, unit="in", res=175, pointsize=10)
  
  # center map (only if ship moved)
  if(nrow(idf)!=0){
    mlat = idf$latitude[which.max(idf$time)]
    mlon = idf$longitude[which.max(idf$time)]
    p = paste0("+proj=ortho +lat_0=", mlat, " +lon_0=", mlon)  
  }
  
  # plot
  mapPlot(coastlineWorld, col = 'lightgrey', projection = p)
  
  # plot entire track
  mapPoints(df$longitude,df$latitude, pch = 16, col = 'grey', cex = 1/3)
  
  # add current section
  mapPoints(idf$longitude,idf$latitude, pch = 16, col = 'blue', cex = 2/3)
  
  # add latest
  mapPoints(mlon,mlat, pch = 21, bg = 'red', cex = 1)
  
  # add timestamp
  mtext(text = paste0(format(it1, '%b, %Y')), side = 3, line = 0, adj = 0)
  
  # start message
  if(it==1){
    title('Start!')
  }
  
  # end message
  if(it==length(tseq)-1){
    title('Done!')
  }
  
  # close and save plot
  dev.off()
  
}
```

## Create movie

Now you should have a directory full of monthly maps. The final step is to stitch all these maps together into a movie. In this case we're making a 'gif', but it can be any number of types of movie files. The way I do this requires us to step outside `R` and use the [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php) command line tool. If you have a mac, imagemagick is easily installed with the [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager using the command `brew install imagemagick` (see the full formula [here](http://brewformulas.org/Imagemagick)). The segment below assembles a system command to execute imagemagick's [convert](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) function from within `R`.

``` {r movie, eval=FALSE}
# write system command
cmd = paste0('convert -antialias -delay 1x', movie_speed, ' ', map_dir, '/*.png ', outfile)

# execute system command
system(cmd)

# remove temporary files
unlink(map_dir, recursive = T)
```

There it is! It's not perfect, but it shows the voyage with an extra level of detail not available in the static map. This is, of course, a simple example but the same approach can be tweaked scaled to display much more complicated datasets. Enjoy!
