# **Programming Tutorials**

## Summary

A fellow grad student and I are developing some material to help upper-level undergrad and first year graduate students learn the basics of programming in R and Python. These are very informal, hands-on tutorial sessions meant to take place over the course of about 10 weeks (5 for R and 5 for Python). I'm leading the R sessions. You can check out our tutorial website [here](https://christophrenkl.github.io/programming_tutorials/). The tutorials and all related material are freely available to use and distribute. Here's the syllabus for the R tutorials to get a rough sense of what is covered:
