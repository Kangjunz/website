<!-- This website is built with [Hugo](https://hugo.com) using a modified version of the [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) theme. I host it for free on GitHub pages, though I do pay a small annual fee to Google Domain for the domain name. I started out with Jekyll, but making the switch to Hugo wasn't a very big deal. I did it so that I could take advantage of the beautiful integration of Hugo and R made possible by the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package. If you're interested you can check out all the source code [here](https://github.com/hansenjohnson/website/). -->
