# About me

My name is Hansen Johnson. I'm a PhD student at Dalhousie University, and a guest student at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution where I work with
[Dr. Chris Taggart](http://fishocean.ocean.dal.ca/about/") and
[Dr. Mark Baumgartner](http://www.whoi.edu/sbl/liteSite.do?litesiteid=5252)
respectively. I study baleen whale acoustics and habitat ecology in the Northwest Atlantic.
My goals for this website are to 1) share some aspects of my
[research](/projects/#research) and 2) contribute some code and advice to the vast
repository of online knowledge that I so often turn to for help. If you're interested in any of this stuff, don't hesitate to [get in touch!](/contact/)
